# Sheduling-Qm-prmp-Lmax
In this project, a tool as a shiny dashboard was created to solve the scheduling problem with parallel machines, allowing preemption, and aiming to minimiza the maximum lateness (Qm|prmp|Lmax).

An instance is included as the files "Jobs.csv" and "Groups.csv".

The tool can be accessed in the following link: https://juanseripe.shinyapps.io/Proyecto/
